Automatic License Plate Recognition on an  embedded ARM micro-controller

Video demo available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljupOdZA1aM

-	Worked in a team to build an embedded system with Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) for
  parking lot payment automation

- The system takes pictures of vehicles with a camera to store their license plate numbers with 
  timestamps in an SQLite database, where the stored license plate numbers are used as unique identification numbers

-	Image processing and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) implemented in C++ with OpenCV and 
  Tesseract-OCR Engine on a BeagleBone Black ARM micro-controller
